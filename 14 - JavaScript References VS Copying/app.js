// You might think we can just do something like this:
team[3] = "Lux";

// however what happens when we update that array?
// now here is the problem!
// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();

// one way

// or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players);

// or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];

// use array.from()
const team5 = array.from(players);
// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
// with Objects
const person = {
  name: "Wes Bos",
  age: 80,
};

// and think we make a copy:
const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;

// how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
console.log(cap2);

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const cap3 = { ...person };

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
// 1 deep means that it wont cover anything like the object of object
